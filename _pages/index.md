## Welcome

The Duke Information Spaces Project develops sensor arrays for real-time virtual reality broadcasting. As an example, the image shown above was captured by the DISP's AWARE10 camera at the 2013 ACC Championship Game. Click here to view an AWARE10 image interactively. Click [here](http://www.gigapan.com/gigapans/146504) to see more shots from the game.  Current research topics include 

(1) sensor system design, including lens design and computer architecture, to capture and broadcast events in real-time and 
(2) The use of artificial intelligence to
- control capture parameters, such as focus, exposure and attention in camera arrays
- manage gigapixel/second data streams, e.g. compress and analyze
- and composite virtual reality from sensor data streams. 

DISP was previously known as the Duke Imaging and Spectroscopy Program, which focused on physical layer coding, generalized sampling and nonlinear signal processing to build optical imaging and spectroscopy systems spanning x-ray to radio wave frequencies. DISP is affiliated with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, the Fitzpatrick Institute for Photonics and the Pratt School of Engineering at Duke University.

More details on DISP can be found by exploring the publications on our [google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=CcSZwTsAAAAJ&hl=en) page or by looking at the textbook [Optical Imaging and Spectroscopy](http://www.opticalimaging.org/).
