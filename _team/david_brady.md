## Research Summary

Brady focuses on computational imaging. Brady led the joint Duke University and University of Arizona team that built the world’s first gigapixel camera in 2012. His subsequent work has focused on reducing the size, weight, power and cost of gigapixel cameras while also improving depth of field, color fidelity, frame frame rate and other measures of image quality. Brady’s current work focuses on aperture synthesis and interferometric super-resolution techniques to continue to push the physical limits of optical sensing. His lab relies heavily on artificial neural networks for camera system control, data management and image estimation. He has also pioneered compressive tomographic imaging systems for efficient hyperspectral, high frame rate, x-ray and millimeter wave imaging.
